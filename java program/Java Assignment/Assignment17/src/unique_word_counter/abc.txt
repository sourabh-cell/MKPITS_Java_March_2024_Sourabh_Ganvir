By default, the list of templates contains only predefined templates provided by IntelliJ IDEA.
Some of them are internal, which means they cannot be deleted or renamed.
IntelliJ IDEA shows the names of internal templates in bold.
The names of templates that you modified, as well as custom templates that you created manually, are shown in blue.
