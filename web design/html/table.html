                     Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort was built by the British after they won this area. Mudhoji II Senasaheb Subha was allowed to continue ruling Nagpur after the British had won the battles of Sitaburdi, Sakkardara, and Nagpur. Richard Jenkins entered into a treaty with Mudhoji on 6 January 1818, which was later ratified by the Governor General. Article 7 of the treaty stated: "The two hills of Seetabuldee with the bazaars and land adjoining, to a distance to be hereafter specified, 
                    shall be henceforth included in the British boundary, and such Military works erected as may be deemed necessary.</td>
